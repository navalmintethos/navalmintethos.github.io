I'm a computer nerd from Germany, currently working towards my post-graduate
degree. This blog will contain my ramblings, thoughts on reality, rationalism,
morale and what ever occupies my mind. Sometimes even short stories.

I will use this as a device to practice my writing skills and as a public but
anonymous diary.  The entries will be either in English or German depending on
my mood and the nature of the post.

I will blog here under a pseudonym to free myself from mental blocks and fears
that what I write here will come back to haunt me in the future.  Please honor
my wish to stay anonymous.
